# Python Sandbox

This repository is full of scripts made in my spare time to learn Python.

##linkedlist.py
I made this script after a technical interview where I failed to reverse a simple linked list when asked. I took my time at home and implemented both methods (loop and recursive).

##composite.py
I made this one to see how to implement the Composite pattern in Python. I knew how to do it in C# and Java but not Python. This is an incomplete script.
